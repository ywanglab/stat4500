# Chapter 11: Survival Analysis

Survival Analysis: similar to linear regression, but the outcome variable: *time until an event occurs*, is **censored**: for some $x_i$ (e.g. patient health data), the time to event (such as death) is not available, because the event has not occurred. Ordinary regression solution would discard such a data (of surviving patients) with $x_i$, but Survival Analysis do not, because the fact they survived after the censoring time (e.g. five years) is valuable.

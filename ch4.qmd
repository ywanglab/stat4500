# Chapter 4: Classification

Given a feature vector $X$ and a *qualitative* (categorical) response $Y$ taking
finite values in a set $\mathcal{C}$, the classification task is to
build a classifier $C(X)$ that takes an input $X$ and predicts its class
$Y=C(X)\in \mathcal{C}$. This is often done by model $P(Y=k|X=x)$ for
each $k\in \mathcal{C}$.

##  Linear regression and Classification

-   For a *binary* classification, one can use linear regression and
    does a good job. In this case, the linear regression classifier is
    equivalent to LDA, because $$
    P(Y=1|X=x)= E[Y|X=x]
    $$ However, linear regression may not represent a probability as it
    may give a value outside the interval $[0,1]$.
-   When there are more than two classes, linear regression is not
    appropriate, because any chosen coding of the $Y$ variable imposes an ordering and fixed differences among categories, which may not be implied by the data set. If the coding changes, a dramatic function will be fitted, which is not reasonable.   One should turn to *multiclass logistic regression* or
    *Discriminant Analysis*.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a *discriminative learning*, because it directly
calculates the conditional probability $P(Y|X)$ to make classification. 

### Binary classification
with a single variable Logistic regression simply convert the linear
regression to probability by $$
p(X)=Pr(Y=1|X) =\frac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1 X}}{1+ e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}.
$$ 
Note the *logit* or *log odds* is linear $$
\log\left( \frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}  \right) =\beta_0 +\beta_1 X.
$$ 
Increasing $X$ by one unit, changes the log odds by $\beta_1$. Equivalently, it multiplied the odds by $e^{\beta_1}$. The rate of change of $p(X)$ is no longer a constant, but depends on the current value of $X$. Positive $\beta_1$ implies increasing $p(X)$, and vice vesa. 

The parameters are estimated by maximizing the *liklihood* $$
\ell(\beta_0, \beta_1) =\prod_{i: y_i=1}p(x_i) \prod_{i:y_i=0}(1-p(x_i))
$$ With the estimated parameters $\hat{\beta_j}, j=0,1$, one can
calculate the probability $$
p(X)=Pr(Y=1|X) =\frac{e^{\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1} X}}{1+ e^{\hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1X}}
$$ 

### with multiple variables

In this case, simply let the logit be a linear function of $p$
variables.

Note when there are multiple variables, it's possible to have variables
confounding (especially when two variables are correlated): the coefficient of a variable may changes significantly or
may change sign, this is because the coefficient represents the rate of
change in $Y$ of that variable when holding other variable constants.
The coefficient reflects the effect when other variables are hold
constant, how the variable affects $Y$, and this effect may be different
than when only this variable is used in the model.

::: callout-note
One can include a nonlinear term such as a quadratic term in the logit
model, similar to a linear regression that includes a non-linear term.
:::

### Multi-class logistic regression (multinomial regression) with more than two classes

in this case, we use the *softmax* function to model $$
\text{Pr} (Y=k|X) =\frac{e^{\beta_{0k}+\beta_{1k}X_1+ \cdots + \beta_{pk}X_p}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K e^{\beta_{0\ell}+\beta_{1\ell}X_1+ \cdots + \beta_{p\ell}X_p}} =a_k
$$ for each class $k$.
Note $\Sigma_k a_k=1$ and the cross-entropy loss function is given by
$-\log \ell(\beta)= -\Sigma_k \mathbb{1}_k \log a_k$, where $\beta$ represents all the parameters.

The log odds between $k$th and $k'$th classes equals
$$
\log(\frac{\text{Pr}(Y=k|X=x)}{\text{Pr}(Y=k'|X=x)})=(\beta_{k0}-\beta_{k'0}) + (\beta_{k1}-\beta_{k'1}) + \cdots + (\beta_{kp}-\beta_{k'p})$$

## Discriminant Classifier: Approximating Omptimal Bayes Classifier

Apply the Bayes Theorem, the model $$
\text{Pr}(Y=k|X=x)=\frac{\text{Pr}(X=x|Y=k)\cdot \text{Pr}(Y=k)}{\text{Pr}(X=x)}=\frac{\pi_k f_k(x)}{\sum_{\ell =}^ K \pi_{\ell}f_\ell(x)}
$$ where $\pi_k=\text{Pr(Y=k)}$ is the *marginal* or *prior* probability
for class $k$, and $f_k(x)=\text{Pr}(X=x|Y=k$) is the *density* for $X$
in class $k$. Note the denominator is a *normalizing constant*. So when
making decisions, effectively we compare $\pi_kf_k(x)$, and assign $x$
to a class $k$ with the largest $\pi_kf_k(x)$.

Discriminant uses the full liklihood $P(X,Y)$ to calculate $P(Y|X)$ to
make a classficiation, so it's know as *generative learning*.

-   when $f_k$ is chosen as a normal distribution with constant variance
    ($\sigma^2$) for $p=1$ or correlation matrix $\Sigma$ for $p>1$,
    this leads to the LDA. For $p=1$, the *discriminant score* is given
    by $$
    \delta_k(x) = x\cdot \frac{\mu_k}{\sigma^2}-\frac{\mu_k^2}{2\sigma^2}+\log (\pi_k)
    $$ when $K=2$ and $\pi_1=\pi_2=0.5$m then the *decision boundary* is
    given by $$
    x=\frac{\mu_1+\mu_2}{2}. 
    $$ When $p\ge 2$, assume that $X=(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_p)$ is drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution $X \sim N(\mu_k, \Sigma)$, with a class-specific mean vector and a a common variance matrix. 
    $$
    \delta_k(x) =x^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k-\frac{1}{2}\mu_k^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k +\log \pi_k=c_{k0}+c_{k1}x_1+\cdots +c_{kp}x_p.
    $$ With $\hat{\delta}_k(x)$ for each $k$, it can be converted to the
    class probability by the *softmax* function $$
    \hat{\text{Pr}}(Y=k|X=x)=\frac{e^{\hat{\delta}_k(x)}}{\sum_{\ell=1}^K e^{\hat{\delta}_{\ell}(x)}}
    $$ The $\pi_k$, $\mu_k$ and $\sigma$ are estimate the follwing way:
    $$
    \hat{\pi}_k =\frac{n_k}{n}
    $$ $$
    \hat{\mu}_k = \frac{1}{n_k} \sum_{i:y_i=k} x_i
    $$ $$
    \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n-K}\sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i:y_i=k}(x_i-\hat{\mu}_k)^2=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\frac{n_k-1}{n-K}\hat{\sigma}^2_k
    $$ where
    $\hat{\sigma}_k^2=\frac{1}{n_k-1} \sum_{i:y_i=k}(x_i-\hat{\mu}_k)^2$
    is the estimated variance for the $k$-th class. The score function
    has a quadratic term $$
    \delta_k(x)=-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu_k)^T\Sigma_k^{-1}(x-\mu_k)+\log \pi_k -\frac{1}{2}\log |\Sigma_k|
    $$
-   when each class chooses a different $\Sigma_k$, then it's QDA.
-   when the features are modeled independently, i.e.,
    $f_k(x) = \prod_{j=1}^p f_{jk}(x_j)$, the method is *naive Bayes*,
    and $\Sigma_k$ are diagonal.
    -   Can applied to *mixed* feature vectors (qualitative and
        quantitative). NB does not assume normally distributed predictors. 
    -   Despite strong assumptions, performs well.
    -   Useful when $p$ is very large. 

### Why discriminant analysis

-   When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimation of
    logistic regression is unstable, while LDA does not suffer from this
    problem.
-   if the data size $n$ is small and the distribution of $X$ is
    approximately normal in each of the classes, then LDA is more stable
    than logistic regression. Also used when $K>2$. 
-   when there are more than two classes, LDA provides low-dimensional
    views of the data hence popular. Specifically, when there are $K$
    classes, LDA can be viewed exactly in $K-1$ dimensional plot. This
    is because it essentially classifies to the closest centroid, and
    they span a $K-1$ dimensional plane.
-   For a two-class problem, the logit of $p(Y=1|X=x$) by LDA
    (generative learning) is a linear function in $X$, the same as a
    logistic regression (discriminative learning). The difference lies
    in how the parameters are estimated. But in practive, they are
    similar.

## Generalized Linear Models (GLM)
- Poisson Regression

## Assessment of a classifier
- Confusion matrix
-   Overall error rate: equals to $$
    \frac{FP+FN}{N+P}
    $$
- Class-specific performance: One can adjust the decision boundary (posterior probability threshold) to improve class specific performance at the expense of lowered overall performance. 

  * percentage of TP detected among all positives
  
    $$\text{sensitivity (recall, power)} = TPR = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}=\frac{TP}{P}= 1-\text{Type II error}=1-\beta$$
  this is equal to $1- FNR$, where, 
  FNR is The fraction of positive examples that are classified as negatives
   $$
    FNR = \frac{FN}{FN+TP}=\frac{FN}{P} 
    $$
  
  * percentage of TN detected among all negatives
  $$\text{specificity}= TNR = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}=\frac{TN}{N}$$
  This is equal to $1-FPR$, where, 
  False positive rate (FPR): the fraction of negative examples (N)
    that are classified as positive: $$
    FPR=\frac{FP}{FP+TN}=\frac{FP}{N} = \text{Type I error} (\alpha) 
    $$ 
 


  *   ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve): plot true positive
    rate (TPR=1-Type II error) \~ false positive rate (FPR= 1- specificity=Type I error) as a threshold for the posterior probability of positive class changes from 0
    to 1. The point on the ROC curve closest to the point (0,1)
    corresponds to the best classifier.
  *   AUC (area under the ROC): Overall performance of a classified summarized over all thresholds. AUC measures the probability a random positive example is ranked higher than a random negative example.   A larger AUC indicates a better
    classifier.
    
- class-specific prediction performance 
  *  $$\text{precision} = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}=\frac{TP}{\text{predicted postives}}=1-\text{false discovery proportion}$$

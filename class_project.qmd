# Class Project 

## Goal
to use variaous ML algorithm to predict a meaningful target $Y$ by *classificaion alogorithm* or *regression algorithm*. Present it at COS Resarch Sympsium in the end of April. 
 
 **Data set**: real-world stock price and volume data. We could start with just one stock, e.g. APAL. S&P 500  index, DJ index. 

 refer to the page <https://github.com/ywanglab/Predicting_stock_movement/blob/main/Time_series_stock_data_analysis_ver2.ipynb>. 
 Perform some EDA to feel the data.

 **Questions**: Which are the $X$ variables? price, volume, return, day of week, month of year, etc. 
 What is the $Y$ variable? next-day price, next-day return, next-five-day average price, next-five-day-average return, etc. 

 **Models**

 - Linear regression: 

    * including conituous variables (price, volume), categorical vaiables (day-of-week, month-of-year)
    * transforming $X$ (for including non-linear relation between $Y$ and $X$) or $Y$ (when $Y$ is heteroschedatic, i.e., with varied $\epsilon_i$)
    * plot resudal plot to see if $Var(\epsilon_i)$ is changing. If yes, may appeal to transorming $Y$, e.g., $\log Y$, $\sqrt{Y}$. 
    * investigate outliers (points with unusual $Y$-values) using the *residual plot* or looking at *studentized residual*. 
    * investigate high leverage points (with unusal $x$ values), by calculating *leverage statistics*. 
    * Investigate if there is *colinearity* among the variables by calculating *VIF*. 

- classfication: prediting directions of the stock price movement. (up, same, down): binary (with two direction), or multinomial (more than two values), LDA, QDA
- regularization of the parameters
- selection of variales 
- decision tree: random forest, boosting 
- SVM: support vector machines
- NN
